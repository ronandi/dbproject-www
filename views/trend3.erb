  <p class="lead">SQL Query: <code>select beers.abv as favorite_abv, avg(b1.abv) as liked_abv_average<br/>
    from favorite join beers on beer = name join drinkers on drinker_id = id<br/>
    join likes on likes.drinker_id = id join beers b1 on likes.beer = b1.name<br/>
    group by favorite_abv</code>
  </p>
  <p>
  Here we have grouped all people who share the same abv on their favorite beer, and have computed the average 
  abv of their likes. You can see that as the abv of oneâ€™s favorite beer goes up, so does the average of their liked beers.
  People tend to favor strong or light drinks depending on their tastes.
